# Responsive Image Swap

Many advertisers arenâ€™t quite ready to jump into the world of responsive advertising quite yet. This template allows advertisers to produce a responsive-like experience using a few static assets. A screen-size appropriate image is displayed to all users even if the advertisement itself isn't responsive. This template displays one of three images depending on the size and orientation of the device. Images are centered, scaled (down) and fit to the device.

3. Zip up the directory and upload it via the Publisher Dashboard.
